# Atlas Site Revamp

A clean, dashboard-style website revamp for Atlas - a growing lab of tools for real estate intelligence.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project transforms the existing Atlas website into a minimal, organic interface with fluid Apple-inspired animations. Built with a modal-first design approach, it serves as a public window into Atlas's product lab, showcasing tools and the build-in-public journey.

### Key Features
- **Dashboard-Style Interface**: No traditional page navigation, everything through modal overlays and panels
- **Paper-Like Organic Design**: Muted beiges, sage green, and orange accents with serif + sans-serif typography
- **Apple Notch-Inspired Animations**: Fluid panel expansions and smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- **Component Modularity**: Built for easy transfer to existing Atlas React/Next.js codebase
- **Content Fidelity**: All content used exactly as specified, no modifications without permission
