```

### Homepage Navigation Cards

#### "What We Build" Card
**Title**: "What We Build"
**Content**: 
> "Atlas creates tools for real estate intelligence."

**Extended Content**:
- Core Message: We build software that helps people and companies make better real estate decisions — starting with AI that can actually interpret properties, neighborhoods, and market context.
- Quote: *"Atlas is building a layer of intelligence on top of Europe's real estate markets. We gather, analyze, and simplify property data so you can make smarter decisions."*
- One-liner: *"From property data to decision-ready insights."*
- Short intro to current tools:
  - 🧠 **Real Estate Analyzer** — AI-generated property reports from public data.
  - 📊 **Comparison Dashboard** (Coming soon) — Compare properties side-by-side.
  - 💸 **Fractional Toolkit** (Later) — Infrastructure for shared real estate ownership.
- Future product path: insights → comparison → action → ownership.

#### "Why We Exist" Card
**Title**: "Why We Exist"
**Content**:
> "Real estate is noisy, slow, and inaccessible — we want to change that."

**Extended Content**:
- Core Message: We believe that good property decisions shouldn't depend on insider access, expensive advisors, or guesswork. That's why we're building smarter tools — to help regular people and smart teams see more clearly.
- Quote: *"We started by trying to fractionalize properties. Then we hit legal walls and shifted focus — now we build tools to understand markets before we transform them."*
- Problems:
  - Data is fragmented and hard to use.
  - Market analysis is often opinion-driven or paywalled.
  - Fractionalization has huge potential but lacks trusted infrastructure.
- Our belief: *Transparency + Intelligence = Better Outcomes*

#### "Who We Are" Card
**Title**: "Who We Are"
**Content**:
> "Small team. Clear mission. No suits, just builders."

**Extended Content**:
- Core Message: We're a multidisciplinary team of builders — combining finance, AI, product, and design — on a mission to make real estate smarter, more accessible, and more honest.
- Quote: *"We're a small European team — data freaks, product nerds, and frustrated investors — trying to make real estate less murky."*
- Content Ideas:
  - Short bios with roles (1–2 lines max each)
  - Origin story: started with the idea of fractional investing → pivoted to building trust through tools.
  - Link to our Operating Principles (Codex)
  - "Built from the Netherlands & Spain"

#### "Our Timeline" Card
**Title**: "Our Timeline"
**Content**:
> "From messy Figma files to a growing ecosystem."

**Extended Content**:
- Core Message: We build in phases. This is what we've done, what we're doing now, and what's next.
- Content Ideas:
  - Visual horizontal timeline or tabbed phase layout
  - Current Phase (e.g. "MVP + Signal")
  - Upcoming: Validation & Revenue → Monetization → Return to Fractionalization
  - Link to full Project Log
  - Quote or belief: *"We build in public because we believe trust is earned through clarity."*
