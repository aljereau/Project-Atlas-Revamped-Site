# Phase 1: Foundation & Design System Setup - Definition

## Overview

This phase focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure for the Atlas Site Revamp project's dashboard-style interface. The goal is to set up the Next.js project structure with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, define the comprehensive design system with muted color palette and organic typography, and create the modal/panel component architecture for maximum transferability to the existing Atlas codebase.

## Objectives

1. **Establish Next.js Project Structure**: Set up Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion in organized folder structure
2. **Define Design System**: Create comprehensive color palette based on muted beiges, sage green, and orange accents with paper-like organic typography
3. **Build Component Architecture Foundation**: Set up modular component structure with clear separation between homepage, modals, UI components, and navigation
4. **Implement Modal System Base**: Create centralized modal management system with smooth animations and overlay handling
5. **Ensure Transferability**: Design all components with clean props interfaces for seamless integration into existing Atlas codebase

## Prerequisites

* **Project Overview Complete**: `Atlas-Site-Revamp-Project-Overview.md` finalized with complete component architecture and technical specifications ✅
* **Universal Project Structure**: All 15 project folders created following `@universal-project-structure-governance-001.mdc` ✅
* **Development Environment**: Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn available for Next.js development ✅
* **Design Reference**: Atlas-Design-System.md with paper-like organic aesthetic ✅
* **Content Requirements**: All content specifications documented and approved for exact usage ✅

## Assumptions

* **Existing Codebase Compatibility**: Current Atlas React/Next.js infrastructure will accept modular component integration without major modifications
* **Design System Flexibility**: Muted color palette and organic typography will work effectively across all planned modal and panel interfaces
* **Animation Performance**: Framer Motion animations will perform smoothly on target devices without significant optimization
* **Component Modularity**: Clean separation between homepage teasers and full modal content will provide clear user experience

## Scope

### In Scope:

* **Next.js Project Setup**: Complete project initialization with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, ESLint, and Prettier configuration
* **Design System Definition**: Color palette (muted beiges, sage green, orange), typography system (serif + sans-serif), spacing, and component styling standards
* **Component Architecture**: Folder structure with `/components/homepage/`, `/components/modals/`, `/components/ui/`, `/components/navigation/`
* **Modal System Foundation**: Base modal management with state handling, animation coordination, and overlay management
* **Development Standards**: TypeScript type definitions, component documentation templates, and integration guidelines

### Out of Scope:

* **Actual Content Integration**: Real content will be integrated in Phase 3 (using placeholder content for foundation testing)
* **Full Animation Implementation**: Complex Apple notch-inspired animations deferred to Phase 4 (basic modal open/close only)
* **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design and mobile-specific interactions addressed in Phase 4
* **API Integration**: Real Estate Analyzer and other tool integrations handled in later phases

## Risk Assessment

### High Impact Risks:
1. **Component Transferability Issues**: Risk that component architecture doesn't integrate smoothly with existing Atlas codebase
   - **Mitigation**: Regular compatibility testing with existing codebase structure, clear documentation of dependencies
   - **Contingency**: Redesign component interfaces if integration issues discovered

2. **Design System Inconsistency**: Risk that color palette and typography don't achieve desired organic, paper-like aesthetic
   - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive design tokens and test across different component types
   - **Contingency**: Iterate on color palette and typography based on visual testing results

### Medium Impact Risks:
3. **Modal System Complexity**: Risk that centralized modal management becomes overly complex for simple use cases
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple modal implementation and add complexity gradually
   - **Contingency**: Simplify modal system if complexity impacts development speed

4. **TypeScript Configuration Issues**: Risk of TypeScript setup conflicts with existing Atlas project configuration
   - **Mitigation**: Review existing Atlas TypeScript config and ensure compatibility
   - **Contingency**: Adjust TypeScript configuration to match existing project standards

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards:
- **TypeScript First**: All components must have proper TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **Component Documentation**: Every component requires JSDoc comments explaining purpose, props, and usage
- **Clean Imports**: Use index files for clean component imports and avoid deep folder references
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions for components, types, and files

### Testing Requirements:
- **Component Functionality**: Basic component rendering tests for all base components
- **Modal System**: Test modal open/close functionality and state management
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Ensure all TypeScript compiles without errors
- **Design System**: Visual verification that color palette and typography render correctly

### Quality Assurance:
- **Code Quality**: All code must pass ESLint and Prettier formatting
- **Component Modularity**: Verify components can be easily exported and imported
- **Performance**: Ensure modal animations run smoothly at 60fps
- **Transferability**: Test that components work independently of project structure
