# Atlas Site Revamp - Project Overview & Roadmap

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

### 1.1. Project Statement
To revamp the existing Atlas website into a clean, dashboard-style showcase that transforms the current marketing site into a dynamic front-end window for the Atlas product lab. This project will create a minimal, organic paper-like interface with fluid Apple-inspired animations using modal overlays and panels (no traditional page navigation) that communicates the company's mission, hosts project tools, and reflects the real-time nature of Atlas's real estate intelligence products.

### 1.2. Key Objectives
1. **Transform Site Architecture**: Convert from marketing site to dashboard-style modal/panel system with no traditional page navigation
2. **Implement Component-Based Design**: Build modular, transferable React components that can be easily integrated into existing Next.js codebase
3. **Create Modal-Based Navigation**: All content accessed through expandable panels and modal overlays maintaining dashboard aesthetic
4. **Establish Design System**: Develop cohesive visual identity with muted beiges, sage green, and orange accent colors
5. **Enable Future Tool Integration**: Build componentized placeholder for Real Estate Analyzer with architecture ready for full UI development

### 1.3. Target Audience/Users
Primary users are prospective customers, investors, and industry professionals seeking real estate intelligence tools. Secondary audiences include potential partners, team members, and anyone following Atlas's build-in-public journey. The interface should appeal to data-driven decision makers who value substance over marketing fluff.

## 2. Core Principles & Guiding Philosophies

1. **Modal-First Design**: All navigation through panels and modal overlays, maintaining dashboard feel throughout
2. **Component Modularity**: Build every element as transferable, reusable components for easy integration and future expansion
3. **Content Fidelity**: Use provided content exactly as written, seeking permission before any modifications or polish
4. **Dashboard Aesthetics**: Prioritize clean, minimal design inspired by remarkable.com, nav.al, Basecamp, and Stripe Press
5. **Performance First**: Implement smooth, fluid animations without compromising load times or user experience
6. **Multi-Persona Support**: Design Get Involved section for different user types (investors, companies, users, feature requests)
7. **Future-Ready Architecture**: Design component structure to accommodate future tools and features seamlessly

## 3. Project Structure & Governance

## 9. Initial Risk Considerations (Project-Level)

1. **Modal Complexity Risk**: Managing multiple overlapping modals and navigation state
   Mitigation: Implement centralized modal state management and clear navigation hierarchy

2. **Content Hierarchy Confusion**: Users getting lost between homepage teasers and full modal content
   Mitigation: Clear visual indicators and smooth transitions between teaser and full content

3. **Mobile Modal Experience**: Ensuring dashboard feel translates to mobile modal interactions
   Mitigation: Progressive enhancement with mobile-optimized modal behaviors

4. **Animation Performance**: Complex modal animations impacting performance
   Mitigation: Performance monitoring and reduced-motion alternatives
